A simple offline music player app written in Kotlin for Android. The app has two versions: KTMusic Bass, which uses the [BASS](https://www.un4seen.com/) library from [un4seen](https://www.un4seen.com/), and KTMusic Exo, which uses the Android [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/media/media3/exoplayer) API.

## üöÄ Motivation
I wanted a music app that would allow me to loop only a part of the songs I like (A-B loop), and at the same time, use the [BASS](https://www.un4seen.com/) library from [un4seen](https://www.un4seen.com/) because it plays tracks with great quality, and I like all the equalizer effects that can be implemented. But none of the apps I liked had the A-B loop repeat function, so I ended up doing more than I needed since I'm not a purist when it comes to audio player features. Still, I'm happy with what I‚Äôve achieved and what I‚Äôve learned, although it‚Äôs not perfect, I‚Äôll keep improving it over time, and I hope it can be helpful to anyone who needs an example of an audio player for Android. Feel free to use the code published here as you see fit.

## üì• Demo

## ‚ú® Features that could be added
I think there are many, xD. One of the most interesting ones is using MediaStore to scan and list the music files. When I discovered I could use it, the project was already quite advanced, and I was a bit lazy to implement it at that point, xD. Also, I like being able to add and remove files however I want, in whatever order I choose. For now, the files or directories where the tracks are located are added manually in a very simple way, so it shouldn't be a challenge. That said, I'm considering adding a version that uses MediaStore.
